### Research Style:
I am deeply interested in exploring methods and the underlying principles of models, with a particular emphasis on approaching problems from a mathematical perspective. I believe that rigorous theoretical analysis provides a clear and logical reasoning path, which, when combined with practical experimentation, leads to more solid and impactful research outcomes. Mathematics, in my view, is not only a tool but also a guiding framework for building and understanding models.

### Personal Traits:
I enjoy exchanging and sharing ideas, as I believe that meaningful research often emerges from the spark of intellectual discussions. I frequently generate new ideas and value the process of discussing them with advisors and peers, which often inspires fresh directions. I am highly self-motivated and like to push myself toward achieving set research goals, finding satisfaction in the process of discovery. I look forward to collaborating with future colleagues and mentors, listening to diverse perspectives, and generating novel research topics through such exchanges.

### Future Outlook:
My current research focuses on large language models (LLMs), starting from analyzing their structures and principles to developing methods that address current challenges, with the goal of creating more efficient, reliable, and generalizable models.. Beyond this, I am excited about the application of AI in scientific domains, such as physics. My previous work in gravitational theory and string theory has sparked ideas on how advanced AI models could be leveraged to address complex scientific problems. In the long term, I hope to contribute to developing methods and models that not only advance AI itself but also serve as powerful tools for accelerating scientific discovery.
