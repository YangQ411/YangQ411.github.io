I am a Master’s student in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University with experience in machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs). I enjoy exploring how different models work — their structures, principles, and ways to improve their performance. I believe AI, especially LLMs, has vast potential but also many open challenges. I aim to explore and address these challenges, enjoying the process of research while working toward more efficient models that can be applied across science, engineering, and beyond.

Research Interesting
======

Large Language Model
-----

I focus on efficient fine-tuning of LLMs through LoRA/QLoRA, precision optimization (FP16, BF16, FP32), and distributed training strategies (FSDP, DDP, tensor parallelism). I am also interested in reinforcement learning for alignment (RLHF, PPO, DPO) and reliable evaluation of LLMs using both traditional metrics and LLM-as-a-judge methods.

AI for Science
------

-  **Applying LLMs and AI models to scientific domains** — exploring how artificial intelligence can assist in solving complex problems in science research such as physics, mathematics, and other scientific fields.  
- **Building new models and algorithms for scientific research** — developing computational frameworks and models that to promote new discoveries and theoretical advancements.
