I am a Masterâ€™s student in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University. My research focuses on large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), distributed training, and reinforcement learning for alignment. I am particularly interested in bridging high-performance computing with LLM optimization to improve efficiency and scalability.

Large Language Model
-----

I focus on efficient fine-tuning of LLMs through LoRA/QLoRA, precision optimization (FP16, BF16, FP32), and distributed training strategies (FSDP, DDP, tensor parallelism). I am also interested in reinforcement learning for alignment (RLHF, PPO, DPO) and reliable evaluation of LLMs using both traditional metrics and LLM-as-a-judge methods.

AI for Science
------

I explore how machine learning and large language models can accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in physics. My past work includes modeling string cosmology and black hole thermodynamics, and I aim to leverage HPC and AI methods to address complex problems in scientific research.
