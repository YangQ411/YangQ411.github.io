I am a Master’s student in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University with experience in machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs). I enjoy exploring how different models work — their structures, principles, and ways to improve their performance. I believe AI, especially LLMs, has vast potential but also many open challenges. I aim to explore and address these challenges, enjoying the process of research while working toward more efficient models that can be applied across science, engineering, and beyond.
