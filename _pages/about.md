I am a Masterâ€™s student in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University. My research focuses on large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), distributed training, and reinforcement learning for alignment. I am particularly interested in bridging high-performance computing with LLM optimization to improve efficiency and scalability.
