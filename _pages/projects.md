Here are some of my selected projects:

## ðŸ¦™ Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Hybrid Fine-Tuning and Parallelism for Llama3 Model
- Explored precision formats (FP16, BF16) and LoRA insertion strategies on LLaMA-3.2B.  
- Evaluated with MMLU, BLEU, ROUGE-L, perplexity.  
- Planned for submission to **EACL 2026**.

## Personalized Chatbot with RLHF
- Built a chatbot capable of mimicking the style of a famous economist.  
- Used **LLaMA-3** as the base model, enhanced with **PPO/DPO** fine-tuning.  
- Demonstrated ability to adapt answers to specific economics-related queries.

## Survey and Benchmarking of LLM Evaluation Methods
- Instrumented MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort with custom statistics (comparisons, swaps, memory).  
- Benchmarked performance on large datasets (10,000â€“256,000).  
- Identified key predictors of runtime efficiency.  
[Paper Draft](#)

## ðŸŒŒ Physics Research (Past Work)

## Non-singular String Cosmology with Matter Sources via all Order Alpha^prime Corrections
- Instrumented MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort with custom statistics (comparisons, swaps, memory).  
- Benchmarked performance on large datasets (10,000â€“256,000).  
- Identified key predictors of runtime efficiency.

## Derive Quasi-topological Gravity from String Theory in Cosmological Background
- Instrumented MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort with custom statistics (comparisons, swaps, memory).  
- Benchmarked performance on large datasets (10,000â€“256,000).  
- Identified key predictors of runtime efficiency.
