**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel across natural language processing tasks, but their massive parameter sizes make full fine-tuning computationally prohibitive. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) provides an efficient parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alternative. However, the optimal placement of LoRA modules across model components remains unclear. We propose a unified and reproducible evaluation framework that systematically assesses LoRA placement across accuracy, efficiency, and resource dimensions, and conduct a comprehensive comparative study across representative open-source LLMs. The framework integrates Pareto frontier and knee-point trade-off analysis to identify balanced configurations among multiple insertion strategies spanning attention, MLP, output projection, embedding, and their combinations. Our results reveal that not all placement strategies improve model performance, and that more trainable parameters do not necessarily yield better results. We further observe consistent patterns across different LLMs, suggesting generalizable placement principles. Our findings establish a systematic foundation for analyzing LoRA placement, provide practical guidelines for efficient fine-tuning under resource constraints, and offer a generalizable methodology for future parameter-efficient fine-tuning research.
