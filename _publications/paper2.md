title: "Thermodynamics and Phase Transition in Central Charge Criticality of Charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS Black Holes"
collection: publications
category: physics
permalink: /publication/paper2
excerpt: 'Introduced the central charge into the first law of thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes using the duality relation of the central charge in AdS/CFT correspondence. Calculated the critical value of thermodynamical variables using Wolfram Mathematica; analyzed corresponding thermodynamic properties of black holes. Wrote a painting program to draw phase diagrams of black holes in different dimensions using Wolfram Mathematica; demonstrated the new thermodynamic phase transition behavior of black holes.'
